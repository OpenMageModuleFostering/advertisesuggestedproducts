            <h1>Activating Adverti.se Suggested Products</h1>
            <p>Thank you for installing our Suggested Products module. <br /><br />
                Suggested Products is a collection of three separate modules that individually suggest
                Related Products, Upsell Products and Cross-sell Products.<br /><br />
                Any combination of these modules can be active on your store at the same time - 
                one, two or all three at the same time.<br /><br />

                Before any suggested products will appear in the front end of your site you 
                need to complete some simple modifications to your current theme's 
                template files.<br />
                <br />
                Please see the individual module pages for details:<br />
